My name is Imsara Samarasinghe. I graduated with my MEng in Aeronautical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2024. During my time at university, I focused on the study of CFD and FE codes. I would like to further pursue this as a career in the future. I am currently looking for a role as a simulation engineer.

I have developed programming skills in Python, C++, Matlab and Fortran. I have written CFD codes that utilise MPI libraries to perform HPC-based fluid simulations. If you would like to see more of my projects download my CV in the link below.
